    "\n",
    "PyTorchâ€™s `nn.Conv2d` is a core layer for building **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**. It applies a set of **learnable filters (kernels)** to 2D input data, typically images, to extract spatial features like edges, textures, and patterns.\n",

    "A convolutional layer scans small filters across the input image and computes **dot products** between the filter and parts of the input, producing a **feature map** (also called an activation map).\n",
